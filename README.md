- Black screen after startup (SystemUI cannot be loaded) 
- Wi-Fi is not accessible
- Baseband-related communications cannot be accessed

A study of generation dynamics of a universal kernel image was conducted on Pixel 8. can be started.
> **Software Interaction**
>
> Texture cleaning: When susFS is used in combination with texture cleaning, there is an interaction between the nuclear generation dynamics and nuclear efficiency of the two. After SUSFS was launched, it was reported that users who used texture cleanup reported that the umount app displayed 0B of remaining space. In addition, the knock-on effects of this incident include the inability to launch the WeChat applet.
